### Briefly About Myself:desire to develop
I work as a design engineer in mechanical engineering.
I tried myself in testing, but realized that it wasn't mine.
A couple of years ago, I became interested in learning the Java language.  I studied CSS and HTML.
Now I want to gain knowledge in the profession of a web developer and apply them in the future.
I consider my positive sides: sociability, responsibility, desire to develop,resistance to stress.
